# @cuecraft/byok

Function-first text generation, provider runtime, and model discovery for bring-your-own-key AI applications.

`@cuecraft/byok` lets a TypeScript app run against user-supplied AI accounts without owning provider-specific generation code. For first success, call `generateText` with an explicit provider, credential, model, and prompt. For setup flows, call `listModels` before a model is selected. When an app needs connection testing, structured output, or custom runtime methods, BYOK also exposes the lower-level provider runtime.

This package currently lives inside the CueCraft workspace and is not published yet. The API is shaped for extraction into a standalone public repository for backend, desktop backend, Electron main-process, and other trusted TypeScript runtimes.

## Features

- Unified runtime for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, xAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, Codex CLI, and Claude CLI.
- One-call `generateText` helper for core providers with default fetch-based transports.
- `createByok` client for repeated text generation with one bound credential or Ollama URL.
- Trusted-runtime main entrypoint for API-key providers and Ollama.
- Node-only subpath for local CLI providers and command execution.
- App-supplied `fetch` and HTTP transports so callers can run in trusted Node, desktop backend, Obsidian, test, or custom runtimes.
- Provider metadata for settings UIs: labels, credential fields, model fields, icons, setup requirements, and model-list capability flags.
- Connection testing with user-readable provider errors and rate-limit retry handling for AI SDK providers.
- Model discovery helpers, portable model options, and Anthropic model-selection helpers.
- Plain text generation for every provider runtime.
- Optional structured-object generation for AI SDK providers that expose `generateObject`.
- Setup-state helpers for determining whether credentials, model selection, and verification snapshots are current.

## Provider Support

| Provider ID | Credential | Entry point | Model listing | Generation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `anthropic` | API key + model | `@cuecraft/byok` | Anthropic account models | Text and object |
| `openai` | API key + model | `@cuecraft/byok` | OpenAI model IDs | Text and object |
| `google` | API key + model | `@cuecraft/byok` | Gemini model IDs | Text and object |
| `xai` | API key + model | `@cuecraft/byok` | xAI model IDs | Text and object |
| `openrouter` | API key + model | `@cuecraft/byok` | Portable model options | Text and object-like JSON parsing |
| `ollama` | Host + model | `@cuecraft/byok` | Installed local models | Text |
| `codex-cli` | Local command, optional model | `@cuecraft/byok/node` | Codex CLI model IDs | Text |
| `claude-cli` | Local command, optional model | `@cuecraft/byok/node` | Anthropic model IDs from OpenRouter, without the provider prefix | Text, with JSON-schema hints through `generateText` |

The main entrypoint avoids Node-only process APIs, but it is still intended for trusted host runtimes that can safely receive provider credentials. Use `@cuecraft/byok/node` only from trusted Node or desktop backends that are allowed to spawn local commands.

## Installation

After this package is extracted and published:

```sh
npm install @cuecraft/byok
```

If your application builds schemas directly, install `zod` as an application dependency too:

```sh
npm install zod
```

Inside the CueCraft workspace, the package is consumed through the workspace dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@cuecraft/byok": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

Runtime requirement: Node.js 24 or newer for backend usage. Browser and Electron renderer UIs should call BYOK through a trusted server, main process, local backend, or custom transport rather than importing BYOK directly with provider credentials.

## Entry Points

Use the main entrypoint for trusted-runtime API-key providers, Ollama, and shared types:

```ts
import {
	createByok,
	generateText,
	listModels,
	type ByokProviderDeps,
} from "@cuecraft/byok";
```

Use the Node-only subpath for local CLI providers:

```ts
import {
	createByokNodeProvider,
	type ByokProviderConfig,
	type ByokProviderDeps,
} from "@cuecraft/byok/node";
```

Provider implementation files under `src/providers` and helper files under `src/models` are package internals. Consumers should import from the public entrypoints only.

## Quick Start

This example generates text with OpenAI in Node 24.

```ts
import { ByokProvider, generateText } from "@cuecraft/byok";

const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) throw new Error("Set OPENAI_API_KEY before running this example.");

const { text } = await generateText({
	provider: ByokProvider.OpenAI,
	apiKey,
	model: "gpt-4o-mini",
	prompt: "Explain retrieval-augmented generation in two sentences.",
});

console.log(text);
```

BYOK is AI-SDK-shaped, not AI-SDK-compatible. If your app needs AI SDK `LanguageModel` objects or AI SDK's full result object semantics, use AI SDK directly. Use BYOK when the app's job is to run against user-owned provider credentials and local providers through one small interface.
The function-first API accepts plain text prompts only. Use the lower-level runtime when you need provider-specific generation hints such as JSON response formatting.

BYOK receives credentials only as call inputs. It does not persist or log API keys. Keep BYOK execution behind a trusted server, main process, local backend, or custom transport; browser and Electron renderer UIs should not import BYOK directly with provider credentials.

## Basic Usage

### Reuse a Credential

Use `createByok` when several calls share the same provider credential or Ollama URL. The model stays per call.

```ts
import { ByokProvider, createByok } from "@cuecraft/byok";

const ai = createByok({
	provider: ByokProvider.OpenAI,
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});

const { text } = await ai.generateText({
	model: "gpt-4o-mini",
	prompt: "Draft a short release note for a model-provider SDK.",
});
```

`createByok` is intentionally narrow: it binds the credential or URL, then accepts a model and prompt per call. Use `listModels` for setup-time model discovery.

### List Providers

Use the registry helpers to drive configuration screens or backend allowlists.

```ts
import { byokProviderDefinitions } from "@cuecraft/byok";

for (const provider of byokProviderDefinitions()) {
	console.log(provider.id, provider.label, provider.supportsModelListing);
}
```

### Advanced: Create a Node Runtime

Create a runtime when your app is testing credentials, using structured output, or supplying custom transports.

```ts
import { ByokProvider, createByokNodeProvider } from "@cuecraft/byok/node";

const provider = createByokNodeProvider({
	provider: ByokProvider.OpenAI,
	apiKey,
	model: "gpt-4o-mini",
});
```

Pass custom deps when your host app owns transport behavior:

```ts
const provider = createByokNodeProvider(
	{
		provider: ByokProvider.OpenAI,
		apiKey,
		model: "gpt-4o-mini",
	},
	{ fetchImpl: fetch, http }
);
```

### Test Connection

Every runtime exposes `testConnection()`.

```ts
const status = await provider.testConnection();

if (!status.ok) {
	console.error(status.message);
} else {
	console.log(status.message);
}
```

For providers with model-list support, `status.models` may include model IDs returned during the connection test.

### Fetch Models

Use the top-level `listModels` helper for setup-time model discovery. It does not require a selected model.

```ts
const models = await listModels({
	provider: ByokProvider.OpenAI,
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

Model discovery returns portable `ByokModelOption` values with `id` and `label`. Provider-specific metadata such as pricing, context length, supported parameters, or recommendation badges belongs in provider-specific APIs or the host app.

### Generate Text with a Runtime

```ts
const result = await provider.generateText(
	{
		prompt: "Draft a short release note for a model-provider SDK.",
	},
	abortController.signal
);

console.log(result.text);
```

Text providers may accept JSON-oriented hints:

```ts
const result = await provider.generateText({
	prompt: "Return a JSON object with an `ok` boolean.",
	responseFormat: "json",
	jsonSchema: JSON.stringify({
		type: "object",
		properties: { ok: { type: "boolean" } },
		required: ["ok"],
	}),
});
```

These hints are provider dependent. Host apps should still validate and repair model output.

### Generate Structured Objects

AI SDK based providers expose `generateObject`. Check for the method before calling it because Ollama and local CLI providers are text-only.

```ts
import { z } from "zod/v3";

const schema = z.object({
	title: z.string(),
	risks: z.array(z.string()),
});

if (!provider.generateObject) {
	throw new Error(`${provider.label} does not support structured objects.`);
}

const report = await provider.generateObject({
	prompt: "Return the main risks of storing API keys in plaintext.",
	schema,
});
```

## Model Discovery

Providers with model-list support return portable model options:

```ts
const models = await listModels({
	provider: ByokProvider.OpenAI,
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
// [{ id: "gpt-4o-mini", label: "gpt-4o-mini" }]
```

`ByokModelOption` intentionally contains only `id` and `label`. Provider-specific metadata such as pricing, context length, supported parameters, or recommendation badges belongs in provider-specific APIs or the host app.

### List Models

Use `listModels` when you need setup-time model discovery. Model discovery does not require a selected model:

```ts
import { ByokProvider, listModels } from "@cuecraft/byok";

const models = await listModels({
	provider: ByokProvider.OpenAI,
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

`ByokProvider.Anthropic`, `ByokProvider.OpenAI`, `ByokProvider.Google`, `ByokProvider.Xai`, and `ByokProvider.OpenRouter` use the same API-key shape. `ByokProvider.Ollama` defaults to `http://localhost:11434`; pass `url` only for a different Ollama server.

CLI model discovery is available from the `@cuecraft/byok/node` runtime provider. Codex CLI uses `codex debug models`; Claude CLI fetches Anthropic model IDs from OpenRouter's public model list and strips the OpenRouter provider prefix.

### Use Ollama

Ollama defaults to `http://localhost:11434` instead of using a raw API key.

```ts
import { ByokProvider, generateText } from "@cuecraft/byok";

const response = await generateText({
	provider: ByokProvider.Ollama,
	model: "llama3.1:8b",
	prompt: "Write one sentence about local model inference.",
});
```

Pass `url` only when using a non-default local, LAN, or remote Ollama server. BYOK accepts explicit `http:` and `https:` Ollama URLs without embedded credentials; prompts are sent to the configured URL.

### Use Local CLI Providers

Local CLI providers are available only from the Node subpath.

```ts
import { ByokProvider, createByokNodeProvider } from "@cuecraft/byok/node";

const provider = createByokNodeProvider(
	{
		provider: ByokProvider.ClaudeCli,
		command: "claude",
		model: "sonnet",
	},
	deps
);

const status = await provider.testConnection();
if (!status.ok) throw new Error(status.message);

const { text } = await provider.generateText({
	prompt: "Summarize this backend job failure in one paragraph.",
});
```

CLI providers execute local commands. Only expose them in environments where users expect local process execution.

BYOK does not persist credentials, fetched models, or setup verification state. Host apps own the actual storage schema, encryption, migration flow, and UI-specific model sorting.

## API Reference

See [API.md](./API.md) for the full public API reference, including exported functions, constants, classes, entrypoint differences, and public types.

## SDK Improvement Notes

Follow-up API design items before a broader public release:

- Make structured output capability explicit in provider metadata. Today callers infer it by checking whether `runtime.generateObject` exists.
- Replace OpenRouter's local Zod-to-JSON-schema subset with a more complete schema conversion path before documenting broad schema support.
- Keep app-settings helpers out of the public barrel unless several external consumers need the same storage contract.

These are follow-up API design items, not blockers for documenting the current package.

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
bun run typecheck:byok
bun run typecheck:byok-examples
bun run test:byok
```

From this package directory:

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun run typecheck:examples
bun run test
```

## Package Boundaries

CueCraft owns storage, UI, Obsidian integration, prompting, validation, and note-specific workflows. BYOK receives resolved runtime credentials through provider configs and must not import Obsidian, Electron, DOM UI helpers, CueCraft settings, or CueCraft prompt/validation modules.
